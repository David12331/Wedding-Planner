# Wedding Planner
"Wedding Planner" is a web application designed to serve as an all-encompassing wedding information hub. It provides details about the wedding location, the love story of the couple, and a registry for guests to explore and choose gifts.

## About
"Wedding Planner" makes wedding preparation a breeze by offering a centralized platform for couples to share essential information with their guests. Whether you're interested in the wedding venue, the couple's love story, or finding the perfect gift, this web app has you covered.

## Trello Board
To efficiently plan and implement the different functionalities of the application, we used Trello. The Trello board helped us organize tasks, track progress, and move items from the planning phase to completion.
